# Virginia Tech Pandemic Insights

## Project Overview

The **Virginia Tech Pandemic Insights** project analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of student performance and admissions at Virginia Tech. By examining historical data before, during, and after the pandemic, this project aims to provide valuable insights into how the educational landscape was affected, including changes in admissions trends, student GPAs, grading distributions, and withdrawal rates. The project consists of two key notebooks: **Admission Insights** and **Grade Insights**.

## Notebooks

### 1. Admission Insights
This notebook focuses on analyzing how the COVID-19 pandemic affected high school admissions to Virginia Tech. The following key areas are examined:
- **Overall Admissions Trends**: Tracks the number of applications, offers, and enrollments over several academic years.
- **Pre-COVID vs. Post-COVID Comparison**: Identifies changes in the rates of applications, offers, and enrollments before and after the pandemic.
- **Demographic and Geographic Analysis**: Examines admissions data broken down by gender, first-generation status, in-state vs. out-of-state students, international vs. non-international students, and race/ethnicity.

Through this notebook, users can gain a deep understanding of how the pandemic impacted Virginia Tech's admissions process, both in terms of volume and demographic shifts.

### 2. Grade Insights
This notebook investigates changes in student performance during and after the pandemic. Using course-level GPA data, the notebook focuses on:
- **GPA Trends**: Compares GPA data before, during, and after the pandemic to uncover how grading policies and course delivery changes affected student performance.
- **Grade Distributions**: Examines the shifts in letter grade distributions across the different time periods.
- **Withdraw Rates and Enrollment Patterns**: Tracks how the rates of withdrawals and course enrollments changed over time.
- **Department and Course-Level Analysis**: Identifies the departments and courses that experienced the most significant changes in GPA during the pandemic.

This notebook provides key insights into how students adapted to remote learning, how grading practices evolved, and the courses and departments most affected by the pandemic.
